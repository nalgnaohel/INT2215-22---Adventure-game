# Adventure-game
This is my game project for INT2215 22.
Ghost Hunter is a game about helping a magican reach his destination. However, there are many ghosts on the way, so he needs your help to achieve his goal.

You will mostly use keyboards to control this game:
- Arrow keys to move: Left - right for moving left - right, up for jumping.
- S: use ultimate - the magican's sphere. However, please be aware that this has CD.
- Q: use magic arrows
- E: for attacking at short distances.

I have read some sources, such as lazyfoo, to make this game. BGM, sound effects and images are from the Internet.
Thank you for playing the game. I hope you will enjoy it.
